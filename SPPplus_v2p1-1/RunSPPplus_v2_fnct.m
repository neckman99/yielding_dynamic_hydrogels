% This code calculates the Sequence of Physical Processes (SPP) metrics for
% a given dataset. These metrics are outlined in detail in the papers:
% "Rogers SA (2017) In search of physical meaning: defining transient
% parameters for nonlinear viscoelasticity. Rheol Acta 56:501-525" amd
% "Donley GJ et al. (2019) Time-resolved dynamics of the yielding
% transition in soft materials. JNNFM 58:361-382"

% The procedure reads data from either a .txt file or a .csv file and
% calculates and outputs the results based on both Fourier domain filtering
% (SPPplus_fourier_v2) and/or numerical differentiation
% (SPPbasic_numerical_v1) analysis methods.

% FOR ALL INUTS -> All input data should be in column form. The prefered
% order of variable columns is Time, Strain, Rate, Stress. If the file is
% not in this order, specify the locations of these columns in the variable
% "var_loc". The code assumes the following units: Time (s), Strain (-),
% Rate (1/s), and Stress (Pa). If the units in the input data are
% different, specify the conversion factors in the variable 'var_conv'. If
% only a portion of the points in your file are needed for your analysis,
% the data can be truncated (specified by the variable "data_trunc").

% IF THE INPUT IS .TXT -> The imported file MUST contain exactly 4 columns:
% Time, Strain, Rate, and Stress. (If no rate data is avalible and the data
% is steady state oscilatory, a 3 column file with Time, Strain, and Stress
% MUST be used.) The file MUST NOT contain header rows, as these disrupt
% the import process.

% IF THE INPUT IS .CSV -> The imported file must contain at least 4
% columns. (3 if rate is to be differentiated internally.) The file can
% contain header rows, as well as additional unused columns.

% IF USING THE FOURIER ANALYSIS -> The code requires that the number of
% periods of oscilation MUST BE AN INTEGER. Additionally, it is recomended
% to use an even number of data points in each period of oscilation. These
% allow for the computation of a fourier series fitting the input data.

% IF USING THE NUMERICAL ANALYSIS -> There are two modes for numerical
% differentation. The standard mode (#1) can be used for all data. The
% looped mode (#2) can only be used for steady state oscilatory data, but
% is more acurate for that data.

var_loc = [1,2,3,4]; % Location of each data column in imported file (Time,
    %Strain, Rate, Stress). All inputs MUST be positive integers, except 
    %Rate (3rd index), which can be set to zero to indicate that rate needs
    %to be differentiated from strain. (This differentiation only supports
    %closed-loop periodic data currently)

    %the assumed units: Time (s), Strain (-), Rate (1/s), and Stress (Pa),

    %order. Conversion factors will multiply the data as follows:
    %   (data in file)*(conversion factor)=(data in correct units)
data_trunc = [0,0,0]; % Determines if/how data will be truncated.
    %First index denotes whether truncation of input data will occur
